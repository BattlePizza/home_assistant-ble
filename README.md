# HomeAssistant::Ble

Companion app from home-assistant sending BLE events.

Since HA does not cope well with bluetooth device tracking (https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.bluetooth_le_tracker/) this app runs along home-assistant and sends device tracking to it.

## Installation


$ `gem install home_assistant-ble`

## Usage

Run `home_assistant-ble` binary.

More instruction to launch this as a service with systemd (TODO).
